# HACKTRIN VI

HackTrin VI is the sixth iteration of Trinity School’s annual hackathon and is on Sunday, March 3rd. Middle and high schoolers, of any experience level, can participate. You can form teams of 1-4 students, even across different schools, and work to make projects relating to coding. We'll have workshops and mentors to help you with your projects and learn! You’ll present your projects to our panels of judges to win prizes in multiple categories (including a beginner category)!
